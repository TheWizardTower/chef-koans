long_description <<-END
Matters of small concern should be treated seriously.
Among one's affairs there should not be more than two or three matters
of what one could call great concern. If these are deliberated upon
during ordinary times, they can be understood. Thinking about things
previously and then handling them lightly when the time comes is what
this is all about.
